# HITCH

> Community‑Driven Reward‑Token Hitchhiking App & Movement

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
**HITCH** is not just a ride-sharing application — it's a **cultural shift**. Our mission is to turn everyday travel into a community-powered, brand-supported journey. We want people to stop seeing transportation as just a task — and instead, **embrace the ride** as part of their life story.

We're redefining **urban mobility** and **adventure travel** in India — not with payments, but through **tokenized gratitude**. 

HITCH is a movement where **each ride becomes a contribution**, and **each contribution earns a token**, redeemable for real rewards. Brands gain visibility, users gain value, and the world sees travel differently.

## 🚀 Core Motives
- 🧭 **Promote Adventure, Curiosity & Connection**
- 🫱🏽‍🫲🏿 **Foster a Cultural Shift Toward Shared Mobility**
- 🎁 **Empower People Through Brand-Backed Incentives**
- 🤝 **Build Trust Between Strangers**
- 🚫 **Replace Small Monetary Transfers With Social Value & Experiences**

---

## 🧠 The Out-of-the-Box Angle
- **Not another Uber clone.** HITCH isn't about gig economy drivers.
- **Not about profit-maximizing.** We're making travel *meaningful*.
- **No money exchange.** Riders and Pilots earn tokens, not rupees.
- **Brands fund the rewards.** They gain cultural capital and awareness.
- **Your city becomes your gameboard.** Track routes, earn badges, redeem rewards.

---

## 👥 Roles
- **Riders (Hitchers):** Commuters, travelers, explorers
- **Pilots (Drivers):** Local commuters, adventurers, delivery workers, students

---

## 🎁 Reward Token Ecosystem
Each completed and verified ride earns both participants tokens:
- 🍔 **Food & Bev Token** – McDonald's, Domino’s, Swiggy, local chains
- 🎽 **Clothing Token** – Decathlon, Bewakoof, H&M
- 🥾 **Travel/Trek Token** – Wildcraft, Quechua, Ixigo, Redbus
- 🎟 **Coupon Token** – Zomato Gold, Amazon, Uber credits, Nykaa

### Token Mechanics
- 🚗 1 meaningful, non-duplicate ride = 10 tokens (per user)
- 🎯 100 tokens → redeemable burger | 250 → backpack | 500 → travel coupon
- 🔁 Bonus rides, streaks, group incentives for unlocking tiers

## 🔐 Safety + Anti-Cheating
- GPS validation with geofencing
- Daily ride caps per user
- Unique ride detection using distance, path & time stamps
- Manual & AI audits on suspicious behavior
